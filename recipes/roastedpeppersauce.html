    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is a twist on the classic red sauce recipe, adapted from 
        <a href="https://food52.com/recipes/13722-marcella-hazan-s-tomato-sauce-with-onion-butter" 
        target="_blank">Marcella Hazan's Tomato Sauce with Onion and Butter</a>. If you have not yet 
        tried Marcella's tomato sauce recipe, I highly recommend it, and this is the only tomato 
        sauce I will make anymore.
