    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Homemade pasta may seem like a daunting task to undertake, but it is actually not 
        difficult and almost impossible to mess up, making it a great beginner friendly recipe. 
        It takes a bit of time and effort, but I promise the result is worth it!

        This photo is from the first time my boyfriend made pasta dough and he was terrified of 
        messing it up and ruining dinner because he did not really cook at all at this point. The 
        pasta turned out great, and ever since he has become the primary pasta maker in our home. 
        The thing about making pasta is that it always seems to come together in the end, even if 
        it starts as a big sticky mess of flour and eggs running all over the counter.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all purpose flour, plus extra</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Add the flour to clean, flat working surface.
            <p>
                The amount of flour needed can vary based on the conditions of your kitchen, so it is always helpful to have a little extra to start and keep the flour nearby in case you need more. I like to start with a little extra because it is easy to leave any excess you do not need on the side, but when your hands are covered in a sticky flour mess, it can be annoying to get more.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Make a well in the flour.
            <p></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Crack two eggs into the well.
            <p></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Using a fork, scramble the eggs in the center, trying not to let them spill out of the well.
            <p>
                If your eggs to leak out at any point, DON'T PANIC! It is okay, it will just be a little messy. Eventually all of the eggs and flour will come together and how they get there is not important.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Gradually incorporate the flour into the eggs.
            <p>
                As the mixture thickens, it will become difficult to continue to mix with the fork, so set it aside and use your hands to bring the dough together. As the dough begins to take shape, push aside any extra flour that is not yet incorporated. You may need more as you work the dough if it gets sticky.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Continue to knead the dough until it is very smooth and bounces back partially when poked.
            <p></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover the dough with an upside down bowl or cloth and let it rest on the counter for 30 minutes.
            <p></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Boil water for the pasta.
            <p>
                Before you start working with the dough again, fill a large pot with plenty of water and put it over high heat.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Roll out the pasta dough.
            <p>
                Cut the dough into six portions and set them on a cloth to prevent sticking to the counter. Keep the dough covered with another cloth to prevent it from drying out while you work. Begin rolling them out with the pasta roller, starting on the widest setting. Gradually increment the setting on the pasta roller to the desired noodle thickness. On my machine, I start at 1 and work down to 5, the second thinnest setting.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Dry out the pasta sheets.
            <p>
                Uncover the pasta and let it dry out slightly until it will not stick to itself when cut. Flip the sheets a few times to allow both sides to dry.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Cut the noodles.
            <p>
                The noodles can be cut using one of the settings on the pasta machine if yours has the cutting wheel, otherwise they can be cut by hand with a knife. For wider noodles, such as those seen in my <a href="./roastedpeppersauce.html">Roasted Pepper Sauce</a> recipe, I cut the noodles by hand to a width of about &frac12;". They will expand slightly when cooked.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook the pasta.
            <p>
                When the water has reached a roaring boil, salt it heavily and allow it to return to a roaring boil. Add the pasta and cook about 3 minutes, or until al dente. Fresh pasta cooks very quickly, but the exact timing will depend on how thick your noodles are, so keep a close eye on it and drain when it is ready.
