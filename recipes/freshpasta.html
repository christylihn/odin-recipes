    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Homemade pasta may seem like a daunting task to undertake, but it is actually not 
        difficult and almost impossible to mess up, making it a great beginner friendly recipe. 
        It takes a bit of time and effort, but I promise the result is worth it!

        This photo is from the first time my boyfriend made pasta dough and he was terrified of 
        messing it up and ruining dinner because he did not really cook at all at this point. The 
        pasta turned out great, and ever since he has become the primary pasta maker in our home. 
        The thing about making pasta is that it always seems to come together in the end, even if 
        it starts as a big sticky mess of flour and eggs running all over the counter.
