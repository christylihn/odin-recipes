    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Most macaroni and cheese recipes consist of a heavy, creamy cheese sauce enveloping soft  
        elbow noodles; the thick cheesy goo, almost indistinguishable from the noodles. I find 
        this traditional creamy mac and cheese to be a little too rich for me, but substituting 
        whole milk for cream and limiting the cheese content creates a lighter dish, while still 
        being an indulgent meal of carbs!
    </p>
    <p>
        I grew up eating a very different kind of mac and cheese that was made in layers and 
        baked in the oven to create plenty of texture. My grandmother made this simple recipe 
        often when my brother and I visited and my mom made this countless times while we were 
        growing up. It remains a go-to meal to make in our family and is always a crowd pleaser.
    </p>
    <p>   
        In my grandmother's recipe the noodles are par cooked and layered in a casserole dish 
        with shredded cheese, like a lasagne, then milk is poured over to fill in the gaps. 
        A variety of fillings can be added to customize the dish such as ham, sausage, 
        broccoli, cauliflower, peppers, or my personal favorite: chili. Optional toppings can 
        include breadcrumbs, broken crackers, or more cheese that creates the perfect crispy 
        top layer after baking in the oven. I prefer it plain, but most of my family prefers it 
        served with a smattering of ketchup, bbq sauce, or bulldog sauce.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 375&#8457.
            <p></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Par cook the pasta.
            <p>
                Boil a large pot of water. As the pot comes to a roaring boil, heavily salt the 
                water and add the <strong>dried pasta</strong>. Cook for half of the recommended 
                cook time, the drain and rinse with cold water. The noodles will finish cooking 
                in the oven.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Grease a large casserole dish with <strong>butter</strong> or <strong>oil</strong>.
            <p></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Layer the ingredients in the dish.
            <p>
                Start with a layer of pasta that covers the bottom of the dish, about a third of the 
                pasta. Sprinkle about a third of the <strong>shredded cheddar cheese</strong> evenly 
                over the pasta. If you are including any <strong>mix-ins</strong>, distribute about 
                half of them here. Add <strong>salt</strong> and <strong>fresh cracked black 
                pepper</strong> to taste.
            </p>
            <p>
                Repeat with a second and third layer of pasta, cheese, mix-ins (optional), salt, 
                and pepper. Note: after the second layer, all of the mix-ins will be added.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour the milk over the top.
            <p>
                Gently pour in the <strong>whole milk</strong> until the level has reached 2/3 of 
                the way up the wall of the dish. This should be about 2 cups of milk.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Add your toppings.
            <p>
                Now that the milk has been added, this is the point to put on any crunchy 
                <strong>toppings</strong> you want to include and finish with spots of 
                <strong>butter</strong> distributed over the top. If you are not adding any extra 
                toppings, not to worry, the cheese will crisp up nicely creating that perfect 
                crunchy top.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake for 45 minutes or until done.
            <p>
                Bake on the middle rack until there is browning on the top and the milk is no longer 
                runny. You can check this by carefully tilting the dish to see if the milk flows to 
                the top. 
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
