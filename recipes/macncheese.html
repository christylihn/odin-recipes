    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Most macaroni and cheese recipes consist of a heavy, creamy cheese sauce enveloping soft  
        elbow noodles; the thick cheesy goo, almost indistinguishable from the noodles. I find 
        this traditional creamy mac and cheese to be a little too rich for me, but substituting 
        whole milk for cream and limiting the cheese content creates a lighter dish, while still 
        being an indulgent meal of carbs!
    </p>
    <p>
        I grew up eating a very different kind of mac and cheese that was made in layers and 
        baked in the oven to create plenty of texture. My grandmother made this simple recipe 
        often when my brother and I visited and my mom made this countless times while we were 
        growing up. It remains a go-to meal to make in our family and is always a crowd pleaser.

        In my grandmother's recipe the noodles are par cooked and layered in a casserole dish 
        with shredded cheese, like a lasagne, then milk is poured over to fill in the gaps. 
        A variety of fillings can be added to customize the dish such as ham, sausage, 
        broccoli, cauliflower, peppers, or my personal favorite: chili. Optional toppings can 
        include breadcrumbs, broken crackers, or more cheese that creates the perfect crispy 
        top layer after baking in the oven. I prefer it plain, but most of my family prefers it 
        served with a smattering of ketchup, bbq sauce, or bulldog sauce.
